## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Reading Teaching Vocabulary Visualizer (RTVV)** is an Android application developed as part of a research and deployment project.  
The main goal of this project was to **build a word-scanning app** that helps **teachers, students, and researchers** analyze vocabulary from children’s reading materials.

The app extracts text from book pages using **Google ML Kit OCR**, identifies **sight words**, highlights vocabulary frequency, and supports classroom learning and language research.

The project also focuses on:
- Improving **usability and accuracy** of OCR-based text recognition.  
- Iteratively **updating and refining app features** through multiple versions.  
- Delivering a **stable, bug-free final release (v1.4)** suitable for public use.
